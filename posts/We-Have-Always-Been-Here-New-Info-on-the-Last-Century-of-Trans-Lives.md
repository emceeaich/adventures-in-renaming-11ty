In [an article at the *Pacific Standard*](http://www.psmag.com/politics-and-law/data-on-transgender-americans), Francie Diep reminds everyone that the Trans Rights movement in America didn't start with Jenner or Mock.

Diep's reporting on Benjamin Cerf Harris' [white paper for the US Census Bureau](https://web.archive.org/web/20170112190056/https://www.census.gov/srd/carra/15_03_Likely_Transgender_Individuals_in_ARs_and_2010Census.pdf) which crunched the numbers and found that since 1936, at least 135,000 Americans have transitioned and updated their names and/or gender markers with Social Security, and that most likely underestimates the number of Trans Americans since the SSA started.

I'm delighted to have this analysis in hand because it demonstrates that we Trans Americans have always been here.

**ETA**: Due to Trump's orders to erase LGBTQ+ history, research, and information from Executive Branch controlled servers, we've had to replace the link with one from the Internet Archive.
