In [an article at the *Pacific Standard*](http://www.psmag.com/politics-and-law/data-on-transgender-americans), Francie Diep reminds everyone that the trans* rights movement in America didn't start with Jenner or Mock.

Diep's reporting on Benjamin Cerf Harris' [white paper for the US Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/srd/carra/15_03_Likely_Transgender_Individuals_in_ARs_and_2010Census.pdf) which crunched the numbers and found that since 1936, at least 135,000 Americans have transitioned and updated their names and/or gender markers with Social Security, and that most likely underestimates the number of trans* Americans since the SSA started.

I'm delighted to have this analysis in hand because it demonstrates that we trans* Americans have always been here.
